 Comparative-analysis-of-ML-algorithms-for-Car-Price-Prediction
 
 This repository contains a comprehensive comparative analysis of various machine learning algorithms used for predicting car prices. 

The study takes into account a wide range of car categories including electric, hybrid, automatic, petrol, and diesel-based cars.
The data of different cars is taken from ford car services.

The machine learning algorithms used in this project include Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest Regressor, and XGBoost. 
Among these models, XGBoost achieved the highest accuracy.

In addition to the comparative analysis, this repository also includes a user-friendly dashboard built with Streamlit.
The dashboard allows users to input car attributes such as year, tax, mpg, fuel type, engine size, etc., and get a predicted price for the car.

This project aims to provide insights into the performance of different machine learning algorithms in the context of car price prediction and offers a practical application through the Streamlit dashboard.
